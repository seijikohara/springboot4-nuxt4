# Spring Boot 4 and Nuxt 4 Starter Template

This project uses Kotlin with Java 25 for the backend and Nuxt 4 with SSG (static site generation) mode for the frontend.
Both components are packaged and deployed using Docker.
The Spring Boot server serves the frontend files generated by Nuxt.

## Backend

- Kotlin (Java 25)
- Spring Boot 4 (WebFlux)

## Frontend

- Nuxt 4 (SSG mode)

## Deployment

This project is intended to be deployed using Docker.
Docker containers can be built for both the backend and frontend components and then deployed using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Compose.
The Spring Boot server serves the frontend files generated by Nuxt in SSG mode, enabling seamless integration of the backend and frontend components.
